# Frontend Mentor - REST Countries API with color theme switcher

![Design preview for the REST Countries API with color theme switcher coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

# Overview
## The challenge

The challenge was to integrate the [REST Countries API](https://restcountries.com) to pull country data and display it like in the designs.

Any JavaScript framework/library on the front-end such as [React](https://reactjs.org) or [Vue](https://vuejs.org) was allowed, but I just vanilla javascript. 

## Live Demo

Get the live demo for this project [here](https://ratified.github.io/Rest-Countries-API-with-Color-Theme-Switcher/)

## Users should be able to:

- See all countries from the API on the homepage
- Search for a country using an `input` field
- Filter countries by region
- Click on a country to see more detailed information on a separate page
- Click through to the border countries on the detail page
- Toggle the color scheme between light and dark mode *(optional)*

  


**⚠️ NOTE ⚠️: Sometimes the REST Countries API can go down. We've added a `data.json` file with all the country data if you prefer to use that instead. However, please be aware that the data in the JSON file might not be up-to-date.**
